          Fresh tomatoes are ideal for replenishing the loss of minerals. These
          vegetables contain a lot of acids that our body needs for full-fledged

          In the content of vitamin C, sweet peppers are superior to lemons and
          even black currants! The greatest amount of vitamin is contained
          around the stalk, that is, in the part of the product that is usually
          cut during cleaning.

            Sales consultants are very polite. Many of the products have tried
            and are ready to prompt and recommend to customers. The staff shows
            that they completely share the philosophy of proper nutrition, if
            you can say so.
